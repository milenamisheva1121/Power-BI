# Power BI Dashboards Collection

This repository presents a collection of two Power BI reports, shared as images only (4 pages per report). The dashboards demonstrate a structured, KPI-driven approach to analytics, combining business understanding, data modeling, DAX logic, and user-centered design.
All data used is dummy data. Power BI (.pbix) files are not included.
----------------------
## Report 1 – Product Performance & Returns Analysis
A business-oriented report focused on product sales performance and return behavior, designed to support commercial and operational decision-making.
### Business Objectives
·	Identify best-performing products and categories
·	Detect products with high return rates
·	Monitor return rates as indicators of product quality and customer satisfaction
·	Explore market trends and patterns across customers and regions
·	Enable data-driven decisions for sales and operations teams
----------------------
### What This Report Demonstrates
Data Preparation & Modeling
·	Data cleaning, transformation, and integration using Power Query
·	Structured data model with fact and dimension tables
·	Relationships, calculated columns, and measures built with DAX
Analytical & Visual Layer
·	KPI cards for high-level performance monitoring
·	Bar and column charts for comparisons
·	Line charts for trend analysis
·	Tables and matrices for detailed breakdowns
Geographical Analysis
·	Filled maps and bubble maps for regional performance insights
Dashboard Design & Usability
·	Clean, structured layout with clear visual hierarchy
·	Balance between executive-level KPIs and detailed analytical views
Interactivity & Navigation
·	Report-level and page-level slicers
·	Bookmark-driven navigation using buttons
·	Drill-through pages for deeper, context-specific analysis
User Experience Enhancements
·	Conditional formatting to highlight trends and outliers
·	Custom tooltips to add contextual detail without clutter
·	Dynamic titles and parameters for flexible analysis
----------------------
## Report 2 – Collections, Risk & Payments Performance Dashboard
A significantly more advanced and highly interactive report designed for collections, risk, and payments performance monitoring.
This dashboard focuses on operational KPIs, anomaly detection, and performance efficiency rather than descriptive reporting.
----------------------
Analytical Scope
	Monthly KPIs, including:
	Collection
	Balance (Fraud / Non-Fraud)
	Collection Rate
	Top 10 negative merchants
	Payments trend analysis
	Collection agency efficiency evaluation
	Balance analysis by type using:
	Maps
	Donut charts
	Data classification by:
	MCC
	Country
----------------------
### What This Report Demonstrates
Advanced KPI Design
·	KPI-driven layout aligned with operational decision-making
·	Clear separation between fraud and non-fraud balances
·	Focus on efficiency, risk exposure, and trend monitoring
Advanced DAX Usage
·	Time intelligence for monthly and trend-based KPIs
·	Ranking logic for negative merchants
·	Conditional calculations for balance types and collections
·	Dynamic measures driven by parameter tables
Interactivity & Navigation
	Bookmark-driven navigation for guided analysis flows
	Combination of:
	Report-level filters
	Page-level filters
	Visual-level interactions
	Parameter tables to dynamically switch metrics and perspectives
Visual & UX Design
·	Custom layout with non-standard visual arrangements
·	Donut charts, maps, and KPI cards working together
·	Strong emphasis on explorability and insight discovery
----------------------
## DAX Highlights (Across Both Reports)
·	KPI calculations and performance ratios
·	Time intelligence (monthly trends, comparisons)
·	Ranking and Top N logic
·	Conditional logic for classifications (e.g. fraud vs non-fraud)
·	Dynamic measures controlled by parameter tables
·	Measures designed for reuse and scalability

  ## Conclusion

This dashboard collection demonstrates a structured and deliberate approach to Power BI development, combining business understanding, robust data modeling, and advanced DAX with thoughtful user experience design.

Report 1 focuses on commercial performance and returns analysis, delivering clear, actionable insights through well-structured KPIs, trends, and interactive exploration.

Report 2 addresses a more complex collections, risk, and payments use case, emphasizing KPI-driven monitoring, efficiency analysis, and insight discovery through advanced interactivity and parameterization.

Across both reports, the emphasis is on:

Designing dashboards that support managerial and operational decision-making

Building scalable and reusable DAX-driven logic

Creating intuitive navigation using bookmarks, filters, and parameter tables

Balancing analytical depth with clarity and usability

Overall, this work reflects an ability to design end-to-end Power BI solutions that are not only visually clear, but also analytically sound and aligned with real-world business needs.
